description: Why you should build your own tools and libraries.

Like many of us, I started my development journey in a time before tools like React & Bootstrap were mainstream.
JQuery was a huge force in the ecosystem, and I was authoring CSS on a per-`User-Agent` basis thanks to _the browser wars_
(a period of time when none of the major browsers could seem to reconcile some form of parity with CSS _or_ JS).

Fast forward a decade, I had learned how to build full stack applications with confidence and had pretty good amount
of professional experience under my belt. But I'd mostly stayed in the realm of 'putting things together' - that is,
being a consumer of packages & tools and building things around them. I don't think this situation ever _really_ changes,
depending on your perspective, unless you're willing to build your own OS & supported ecosystem from scratch. _Shout-out to Andreas Kling!_

That being said - I've witnessed countless instances of malware-pushing supply chain attacks and open source tools being
deprecated or becoming pay-walled (Redis, for example). I think it has become the norm to expect the worst from any software
ecosystem, so, except to meet the needs of an employer, why should I partake?

This brings me to the present day. I've got my own collection of very capable open source libraries/tools that I maintain.
None popular, but my own - and I understand them at their very core. And through building them, I've experienced first-hand
what lead the authors of the things I replace to make the decisions they did.

Somehow, building my own things has helped me to better understand and use the things I aimed to replace.

_How about that._
