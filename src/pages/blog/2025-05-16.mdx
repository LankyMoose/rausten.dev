# Garbage Collected Ideas

I'll try to keep things short, sharp, and (hopefully) not completely pointless.
I've never been much of a writer, but I figured it was time to start before my
legacy is reduced to "Fixed typo" and "oops lol".

If all goes well, I'll produce a turn of phrase that makes you think-or at least
snort-laugh inappropriately in a quiet room.

_git push --force_
